I had a few ideas for a space themed seasonal expansion/DLC including new courses, characters, cosmetics, gamemodes and more. Since the game already added a few sci-fi courses such as Arrakku and smith bends as well as Rush Invaders which has a retro theme, this theme would definitely fit well and allow for the newer tracks to see some spotlight. ⠀ ###NEW TRACKS (Descriptions At Bottom) •Moonbase 51 •Cosmic Caverns •Planet Rush •Galactic Outpost ⠀ ###NEW GAMEMODES (Descriptions. My Opinion on this whole situation is, I just wish Riot would make all 3 or at least give us a winner and then put the runner up on the shelf for next time or next year or maybe for a event. If you want to know which skin I chose, it's obvious I chose Sugar Rush. I am a purchaser of cute skins as I've bought Meowkai AND MooCow Alistar, plus their chromas. Now, before I get your downvotes, hear me out. Little Demon is starting to grow on me a bit as I do see it being pretty cute. There's FINAL BIG EDIT: I think we have deduced why sugar rush is in the lead. Everyone who has the loves the more cutesy skin is voting for that one. However the people who want the more aggressive skin is getting split up between galaxy and demon. If they don’t work together sugar rush will end up taking it all. BIG EDIT: ok so I went on the front page of r/leagueoflegends and there’s a comment with a straw poll that shows SUGAR RUSH is in the lead. Which heavily surprises me and throws my theory. Hi all. Long-time lurker here, hoping to be active in the boardgame subreddits. I've really gotten into boardgames over the past few years and started making one recently, with quite a few more in mind. Hope I'm on topic, not reposting, following rules, and in the right place with this. :P I'm wondering about how one chooses a name for their board game without getting into copyright issues. For example, I wanted to call my game "Cosmic Rush" but I see that this is the title for a Sonic video. Hello, and may the Force be with you my friends. Let me first start off by saying that I am having fun with Starwars Battlefront IV aside from the whole micro-transaction debacle. I wanted to take a moment and present an argument for a Battlefield-esque conquest mode. When you think Starwars Battlefront, what comes to mind? Is it glorified games of Rush? Is it lackluster small scale TDM? Is it playing Endor 10,000x to your one amazing Kamino? No quite honestly most of you imagine that classic. Just finished a primary mission and now in Eissentam. Can anyone give me a lift to the Galactic Hub in multiplayer? I’ve got the coordinates but am guessing that I won’t be able to put down a base computer due to Portal Interference. gt#Policy on Non-Consensual PVP amp "Villains" Galactic Hub policy regarding non-consensual PVP (attacks on players who do not wish to participate) is very simple: it's not allowed. (Or rather, it won't be allowed, as it's not currently possible anyway.) For players who want to engage in PVP, we will have options. The exact nature of these options are unknown since NEXT isn't out yet, but will likely include "arena systems" (dedicated systems where random PVP is always allowed), police. 
Let’s not copy the mode Battlefield that was already the core, integral gameplay of the Battlefront series, let’s copy the mode from Battlefield that had nothing to do with Battlefront! Brilliant! And don’t get me started on how Frontlines and Supply Drop in Battlefield 1 copied Supremacy and Drop Zone from Battlefront 2015. The jig’s up, DICE. Add in Conquest Mode so that Battlefront II has a higher chance of surging with a mode that’s open, unpredictable, and player driven. You get one world. albiet a huge one. The question I am at is with life seeded how much does that help or cripple an empire. </p>
